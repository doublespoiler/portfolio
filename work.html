They're very smart, and picked it up really quickly. Calvin, one of the instructors, recommended we look at FlexBox, and we turned it into a flexbox site.</p>

We then used it to practice more Bootstrap with another page in the same repo. Finally, we tried to recreate the style of Wikipedia using bootstrap.</p>

          <p class="card-text">That's this site! I used Bootstrap cards for the majorify of it. The index features a row-within-a-row. I was trying to find ways to overwrite the original color names, and stumbled on the drop shadow code for my CSS. I applied it to cards, and changed the colors.</p>
